I. Computers are divided into three parts
	A. CPU (Central Processing Unit)
	B. Memory Unit (contains program and data for the program)
	C. Input/Output devices
	
II. The CPU
	A. CPU is inside a single integrated circuit called the computer chip
	B. Relatively small
	C. Measured in MHz (megahertz, or machine cycles per second)
	D. Devices such as the keyboard and mouse do their I/O directly through the CPU
	E. Other devices, such as disks, go through memory first
		1. If a disk directly went through CPU, it would slow down dramatically
		2. The CPU has to initiate data transfer, which takes place to or from memory
		   using DMA (direct memory access)

III. Bits
	A. Computer memory is a collection of bits
	B. Short for binary digit
		1. A bit is a collection of two stable states, on and off, represented by 0 and 1
	C. Bits are grouped in collections of 8 bits called bytes
		2. Bytes in memory are numbered from 0 to N - 1, where N is the number of bytes in
		   memory.
